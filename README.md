# jPomo

A pomodoro timer with flexible and customisable timers, built using Next js.

Give it a go! [jpomo.vercel.app](https://jpomo.vercel.app)


## Why I made this project

I have regularly used [pomofocus.io](pomofocus.io) in the past to help with maintaining focus when studying at university. Whilst I really like this timer, I wanted something with a bit more flexibility. After having a look online, I couldn't find anything that met my needs so I decided to create my own.

## What can it do?

jPomo allows you to create virtually unlimited timers, with customisable labels and times that can range from 1 second to 60 minutes. You can reset the current timer if you need to, pause and resume, and skip back and forth through your timers. You can add and delete new timers as you need. 

## Running the project

Run the development server:

```bash
make up # (npm run dev)
# or
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to use locally, or just visit [jpomo.vercel.app](https://jpomo.vercel.app) to use the live version.
